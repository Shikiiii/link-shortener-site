# Link shortener site

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Shikiiii/link-shortener-site)

Simple website that allows shortening of links and processing the short links, alongside with authentication support & a nice-looking dashboard that allows users to view, edit & delete their links, alongside with choosing their own short code.

Built in an attempt to understand Next.js and React. Back-end made with Django.

> [!CAUTION]
> The tech stack is pretty bad. Next.js has built in API support, but these API requests are currently being re-forwarded towards Django. It is not recommend to use this project. It was meant as an easy way to learn a new framework as I already understand Django. But I cannot recommend learning from this project.
